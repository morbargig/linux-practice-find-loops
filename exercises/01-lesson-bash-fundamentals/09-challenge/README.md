# Challenge – Directory Analyzer

Write a script `analyzer.sh` that:

1) Takes a directory path as argument
2) Checks if it exists (if not, print message and exit 1)
3) Finds all `.txt` files in it (including subdirectories)
4) Prints:
   - total count of txt files
   - total size of txt files in bytes

Example:
```bash
./analyzer.sh ../../lab/files
```
