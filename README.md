# Linux Practice – find, loops, if/else & bash scripting (Technician Track)

This repository is a hands-on practice project for Linux scripting fundamentals:
- Installing common tools
- Working with VS Code for bash
- `find` command (basic + advanced)
- loops (`for`, `while`)
- conditions (`if/else`)
- combining `find` + loops for automation
- debugging bash

## Quick Start
1) Clone
```bash
git clone <YOUR_REPO_URL>
cd linux-practice-find-loops
```

2) Setup the lab environment (creates sample files/logs)
```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```

3) Start exercises
- Go to `exercises/`
- Read the README inside each folder
- Complete TODO parts in `.sh` scripts

4) Check your work
```bash
./scripts/check.sh
```

## Rules
- Do not delete the TODO comments
- Keep scripts runnable
- Output format matters (checker expects specific lines)

## Folder Guide
- `scripts/` : setup/reset/check tools
- `lab/`     : generated practice files (safe sandbox)
- `exercises/`: tasks per topic
